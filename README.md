# rollup-plugin-root-import

Add the ability to import modules by the root path, like [babel-root-slash-import](https://github.com/mantrajs/babel-root-slash-import).

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/mixmaxhq/rollup-plugin-root-import.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/mixmaxhq/rollup-plugin-root-import)

```js
// import a module relative to a specified root directory
import UserModel from '/models/user';

// illustrative - if we were in /views/user, we can reference a model's module
// using an absolute path from the root of the project, rather than relative to
// the current module
class UserView {
  // ...
}
```

## Install

```sh
$ yarn add rollup-plugin-root-import
```

or

```sh
$ npm install --save-dev rollup-plugin-root-import
```

## Usage

```js
import { rollup } from 'rollup';
import rootImport from 'rollup-plugin-root-import';

rollup({
  entry: 'client/src/main.js',
  plugins: [
    rootImport({
      // Will first look in `client/src/*` and then `common/src/*`.
      root: `${__dirname}/common/src`,
      useInput: 'prepend',

      // If we don't find the file verbatim, try adding these extensions
      extensions: '.js',
    }),
  ],
});
```

## API

### rootImport([options])

Creates a rollup plugin to resolve absolute-pathed imports relative to the project's entry or
specified root directory/ies.

Options:

- `root` an optional string or ordered array of strings, which represent the roots from which to try
  and resolve imports. You should specify absolute paths (i.e. using `__dirname`) in order for
  downstream Rollup plugins to match module IDs.
- `useInput` if provided, should be either `'prepend'` or `'append'`, where each signify that the
  directory containing the entry should be prepended or appended to the array of roots,
  respectively. By default, if `root` is provided and `useInput` is not provided, the directory of
  the `entry` module will not be used to resolve absolute-pathed imports.
- `extensions`, if provided, specifies a string or ordered array of strings, each of which
  represents an extension to append to the resolved file if the import isn't found verbatim.
